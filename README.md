# I forgot how to make a README!

This project is just the boilerplate setup for a new React app. Webpack is configured to bundle the .js files from the `app/` directory and output a single script and `index.html` file to the `dist/` folder. The dist folder will be created if it does not already exist, and will be overwritten if it does, so don't bother making any changes to the files in there.

## Getting Started:
1. Clone the repo: `$ git clone https://github.com/lukebertram/react-app.git <your-project-folder-name>`
2. `$ cd <your-project-folder-name>`
3. `$ npm install`
4. `$ npm run start` to start the development server
